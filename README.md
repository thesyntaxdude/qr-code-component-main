## My process

I read the readme and just went head first into coding. I realise it's not the
best "strategy" and need to work on that. I will try reading the style guide as
well and any other ocumentations first, plot out a course and sail.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS

### What I learned

Using tools like figma speed up the process.

### Continued development

I think I need to improve my reading and comprehenion skills.
